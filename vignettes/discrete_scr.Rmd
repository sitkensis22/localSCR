## Introduction

<p>
The forth vignette of the 'localSCR' package covers a set of 'discrete' Bayesian spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models (Royle et al. 2014). These inhomogenous point process models are designed to model SCR data for 'marked' or 'unmarked' individuals and model the spatial density of activity centers as a function of some environmental covariate, for instance. Although many distance detection functions are possible, the package currently includes only a bivariate normal model of space use, which is commonly employed in the literature. The package is meant to ease implementation of Bayesian SCR models using the 'nimble' package (de Valpine et a. 2022), which allows for increased flexibilty with the ability for the user to include custom functions and assign different algorithms to specific model parameters. I took advantage of this functionality with the goal of building a simple, straightforward workflow that was flexible enough to handle most mainstream SCR analysis problems. Visit <https://r-nimble.org/download> for information on installing 'nimble' and Rtools on your computer.

## Implementation

<p>
The 'localSCR' package implements Bayesian SCR models using the 'nimble' package (de Valpine et a. 2022) following methods described in Royle et al. (2014). We take advantage of recent developments in computation of SCR models. In this tutorial, two methods are implemented to decrease computational run time:

1) Using vectorized declarations for traps in distance function calculations
2) Separating the data augmentation process into two steps (Chandler 2018)

In some SCR problems, there are landscape features that create 'unsuitable' habitat for the study species. Habitat masks are used to account for these features and designate suitable (1) or unsuitable (0) habitat, and can be represented as a matrix or array of binary values. We follow the methods of Milleret et al. (2019) to implement the "ones" trick to account for habitat suitability. This restricts the possible locations of latent activity centers to only suitable habitat. The 'localSCR' package provides functions to construct a habitat mask from either raster or polygon data. In the discrete model, we'll use the habitat mask to limit the 'pixels' or 'cells' of our discrete state-space, such that only available cells will be sampled.

Finally, in some SCR designs, clusters of trap arrays may be spread out over the study area such that individuals can only be detected at one of multiple trap arrays (e.g., Furnas et al. 2018). This necessitates including the traps as a 3-dimensional array, using a site identifier to track which site a detected or augmented individual belongs to, and using a dynamic indexing in the model.

* `get_discrete()` grabs template model for given inputs using the `nimbleCode()` function
* `grid_classic()` define state-space grid and extent 
* `initialize_classic()` generate starting locations for activity area centers
* `mask_polygon()` create habitat mask matrix or array from polygon
* `nimSummary()` summarize lists of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) output
* `realized_density()` generate realized density surface from MCMC output
* `run_discrete()` wrapper function to run discrete models using 'nimble' package
* `sim_classic()` simulate basic spatial capture-recapture data

Here, we can see the state-space grid that was created after converting the state-space grid, traps, and initial activity centers using `discretize_classic()`. In the figure above, the state-space `grid` is reduced after applying a habitat mask (i.e., the number of rows was decreased) and is plotted with light gray points. Also, we can see that both the the traps `X` (shown as blue points) and initial activity centers `s.st` (shown as orange-red points) are discretized and overlap with the grid locations. We see that the function returns a list of revised grid based on the habitat mask `grid`, the number of available pixels `nPix`, the discretized trap locations `X`, and the grid indices for discretized initial activity center locations `s.st` as a vector.

In this example, We arbitrarily chose a grid resolution of 200 in this example (i.g., `res = 200`) to save model run time when creating the initial state-space using `grid_classic()`, but this will vary by problem. In situations involving habitat masks or discrete models, it is prudent to test the effect of different grid resolutions on the estimated abundance and density in SCR models (see Royle et al. 2014). Also, note the use to the EPSG code to define the coordinate reference system for our state-space (see <https://epsg.io/32608>). 

We also simulated some spatial capture-recapture data using `sim_classic()`. Above, we simulated a 'true' population size of 200 individuals (`N = 200`), 4 sampling occasions (`K = 4`), a single scaling parameter (`sigma_`) of 300 m, a baseline encounter probability of 0.15 (`base_encounter = 0.15`), the proportion of females (for example) (`prop_sex = 0.6`), a binomial encounter distribution (`enc_dist = "binomial"`) and we used our habitat mask (`hab_mask = hab_mask`). We also use `setSeed = 100` to make the simulation reproducible. We provide the function the extent of the state-space output from `grid_classic()` as `ext = Grid$ext`. Note that Grid is a list.

Next, we'll use these data components we created above in a discrete SCR model. The package includes a set of template discrete SCR models that we will use to run the simple example. Note that since we won't directly use `hab_mask` in the model, we won't include it as a data component. Rather, it is accounted for by deleting the coordinates in the `grid` that are unsuitable habitat (i.e., `hab_mask = 0`). Also, it would be easy to modify the model code if covariates were available to model density or the detection process.

We note that the discrete model takes much longer to run compared to the continuous SCR model equivalent (i.e., 'classic' model). This results from using the categorical distribution to sample the pixels of our discrete state-space. In this example we have a somewhat fine grid at 200 m, which results 270 cells that the model has to consider for each individual in our augmented population size of `M = 400`. We also can't take advantage of the block sampling of activity center coordinates that greatly speeds up the classic model runs. 

We can see from the histogram of the posterior samples of `N` that our model estimates were close to the simulated value of 200 individuals (shown by red line) and were biased slightly high at around 217 individuals. This is expected since this is only one realization of the detection process. In this example, we divided the pixelWidth by 1,000 in deriving the area (`A`) in our list of constants. This allowed us to estimate density in activity centers/km<sup>2</sup> rather than activity centers/m<sup>2</sup>. Note that care must be taken with any rescaling of the data or constants.

Next we use`nimSummary()` to quickly summarize the MCMC samples. Note that there are other options to summarize MCMC output, but this function is provided with the package and depends partly on the 'coda' package. Then, we make a realized density plot of the MCMC samples using `realized_density()`. In this function we make use of the list of grid and extent we created earlier called `Grid` as well as our saved coordinates reference system (`mycrs`). 

In this example, we also use the 'raster' package to make a simple plot of the realized density output. For the discrete problem, we need to manually take the samples of pixel indices for each individual (`s`) and recover the grid coordinates for them; thus, we write a bit of manual code to accomplish this using a for loop. We can see that the habitat mask has resulted in some cells having `NA` values where the habitat was unsuitable as expected.

Next we repeat a similar workflow but now we have two trap arrays that are clustered in space, and thus, there is a negligble chance of detecting an individual at more than one trap array. In this case, the functions in 'localSCR' can automatically detect that the traps are in a 3-dimensional format and we note that `sim_classic` will return a variable called `site` that identifies which trap array that each individual (both detected and not detected) belongs to. Note that the number of rows in the simulated data `y` will equal the simulated population size (here in the example, `N = 200`). However, because we are using a trick provided by Chandler (2018) to separate the data augmentation process into two steps, we only need the encounter data for those individuals that were detected in the model likelihood. Also, because we have no occasion-specific detection covariates, we can sum `y` over individuals and traps to result in a 2-dimensional encounter history array (i.e., `y[i,j]`). This speeds us the model under these conditions and we can specify this when we get the SCR model template by setting `y_dim = 2` in `get_classic(y_dim = 2,...)`. Otherwise, the workflow is very similar to having a 2-dimensional trap array in the previous example.

# at one of the trap arrays (e.g., Furnas et al. 2018)

Xarray[,,1]=traps

<p>
In the figure we can see our two spatially separated trapping grids and that the polgon overlaps some of the gridded area. The area outside the polygon will be considered unsuitable when the habitat matrix is created. Note that the `site` variable will be only as long as the simulated population size (here, 200) and thus, we will need to augment the variable to have the length equal to the total augmented population size (i.e., `M = 400`). Otherwise the workflow is very similar to the previous one where we'll use `discretize_classic()` to convert our 'classic' SCR data to a discrete format. We'll use some of the items we created above in this example (e.g., `traps`,`Nsim`).

We might run a few more iterations to have everything nicely converged, but we won't do that here given that it took about 20 minutes to run the model. 

We again make a realized density surface and note that the `realized_density()` function outputs a list of length 2 in this example since we have 2 spatially separated trapping grids here that are in a 3-dimensional array format.

That's it for the discrete models! You've made it through the fourth 'localSCR' tutorial. Please see Royle et al. (2014) for more details about SCR theory and modeling. The next tutorials will focus on applying localapproaches to 'classic' and discrete SCR models. We'll see that significant reductions in computational run time can occur with local approaches depending on the problem, but especially for discrete SCR models where we deal with relatively slow run time.
