Description: Functionality for recent developments in computation for Bayesian spatial capture-recapture (SCR) modeling. The package currently supports 'classic' (continuous state-space) SCR models for marked and unmarked individuals including functions to generate state-space grids, simulate data, build habitat masks, and more. The user-friendly design keeps all objects in simple native R classes such as matrices and arrays for simplicity. The package is still in developments but functionality is coming for discrete state-space models as well as localized approaches that further reduce computational runtime.
