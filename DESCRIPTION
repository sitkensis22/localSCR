Description: Functionality for recent developments in Bayesian spatially-explicit mark recapture modeling. Specifically, model run time is greatly reduced by taking advantage of the R package nimble, which provides users more control caompared to JAGS over sampling algorithms and incorporating custom functions. Additionally, the package currently supports habitat mask for uniform state-space implementation in nimble. Further, users can use the functionality to easily simulate data to aid in research design. All objects are kept in simple native R classes such as matrices and arrays for compatability.
